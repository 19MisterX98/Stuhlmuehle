Just a simple program to calculate optimal moves in an unknown game
The only reference I found online was "Extended tictactoe" in the related game page of Three men's morris
[here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_men%27s_morris#Related_games).

## Game rules
The game is played on a 3x3 board. <br>
Each of the two players has three pieces labeled 1, 2 and 3.

Player1 places their piece no.1 <br>
Player2 places their piece no.1 <br>
Player1 places their piece no.2 <br>
Player2 places their piece no.2 <br>
Player1 places their piece no.3 <br>
Player2 places their piece no.3 <br>
Player1 moves their piece no.1 to an empty spot <br>
Player2 moves their piece no.1 to an empty spot <br>
Player1 moves their piece no.2 to an empty spot <br>
...

This continues until one player has their 3 pieces in a row like in tic-tac-toe
